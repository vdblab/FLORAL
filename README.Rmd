The `FLORAL` package is an open-source computational tool to perform log-ratio lasso regression modeling and compositional feature selection for continuous, binary, time-to-event, and competing risk outcomes. The proposed method adapts the augmented Lagrangian algorithm for a zero-sum constraint optimization problem while enabling a two-stage screening process for extended false-positive control.

The associated article for `FLORAL` is available on [Cell Reports Methods](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-methods/fulltext/S2667-2375(24)00289-3).

## System requirements and installation

The current version of `FLORAL` (0.4.0) was built in R version 4.3.3. R package dependencies can be found in the `DESCRIPTION` file.

You can install `FLORAL` with the following code. The installation is typically complete within minutes.

``` r
install.packages("FLORAL")
```

You can also install `FLORAL` using conda:

``` bash
conda install -c bioconda r-floral
```

You can install the development version of `FLORAL` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vdblab/FLORAL")
```

## Example

Here is a toy example for linear regression with 10-fold cross-validation for a simulated data with 50 samples and 100 compositional features. Option `progress=TRUE` can be used to show the progress bar of the running algorithm. 

The data simulation procedure is described in the preprint. The expected run time for the following demo is about a minute.

```{r example}
set.seed(23420)
library(FLORAL)

dat <- simu(n=50,p=100,model="linear")
fit <- FLORAL(dat$xcount,dat$y,family="gaussian",ncv=10,progress=FALSE)
```

To view plots of cross-validated prediction error and parameter coefficients, use `fit$pmse` or `fit$pcoef`:

```{r plot, echo = FALSE,out.width = "50%",fig.height=4,fig.width=6,dpi=300}
fit$pmse
fit$pcoef
```

To view selected compositional features, use `fit$selected.feature`, where features are sorted by their names. Features under `min` and `1se` correspond to penalty parameter $\lambda_{\min}$ and $\lambda_{\text{1se}}$, respectively. Features under `min.2stage` and `1se.2stage` are obtained after applying 2-stage filtering based on features under `min` and `1se`, respectively.

We recommend interpreting the selected compositional features as potential predictive markers to the outcome in the regression model in the sense that the cross-validated prediction error is improved by considering these selected features. 

```{r feature}
fit$selected.feature
```

To get specific log-ratios selected by the 2-stage procedure, use `fit$step2.log-ratios`, where `min` and `1se` display the log-ratios between features. For each identified ratio, `min.idx` and `1se.idx` return the column indices in the original input matrix for the two corresponding features forming the ratio.

```{r ratio}
fit$step2.ratios
```

More detailed interpretations can be obtained for the selected log-ratios. First, the selected log-ratios also improve the cross-validated prediction errors because these log-ratios are derived from the constrained lasso estimate. Moreover, as guided by the association table between log-ratios and the outcome, it is possible to interpret the directions of the covariate effects associated with certain log-ratios on the outcome. To view detailed associations between selected log-ratios and the outcome, use `fit$step2.tables` to print summary tables for the multivariable stepwise regression models obtained by the 2-stage procedure. 

```{r gtsummary1, eval=FALSE}
fit$step2.tables$min
```

```{r gtsummary2, eval=FALSE}
fit$step2.tables$`1se`
```

For binary and survival outcomes, please specify `family="binomial"`, `family="cox"`, or `family="finegray"` accordingly. 

```{r example2, warning=FALSE}
dat.bin <- simu(n=50,p=100,model="binomial")
fit.bin <- FLORAL(dat.bin$xcount,dat.bin$y,family="binomial",ncv=10,progress=FALSE)

dat.cox <- simu(n=50,p=100,model="cox")
fit.cox <- FLORAL(dat.cox$xcount,survival::Surv(dat.cox$t,dat.cox$d),family="cox",ncv=10,progress=FALSE)

dat.fg <- simu(n=50,p=100,model="finegray")
fit.fg <- FLORAL(dat.cox$xcount,survival::Surv(dat.cox$t,dat.cox$d,type="mstate"),family="finegray",ncv=10,progress=FALSE,step2=FALSE)
```
